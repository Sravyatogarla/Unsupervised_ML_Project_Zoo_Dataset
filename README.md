# 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning Project: Animal Classification using Zoo Dataset

This project applies **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)** techniques to classify animals based on physical and behavioral characteristics. The primary goal is to group animals with similar traits using clustering algorithms and evaluate the patterns discovered.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name:** Zoo Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **File:** `zoo.csv`
- **Description:** Contains 101 animals with 16 boolean features like hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, etc., and a class label (used here only for evaluation).

## 📘 Project Overview

### ✨ Objectives:
- Perform clustering using **K-Means** algorithm.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**.
- Visualize the clusters with **2D PCA**.
- Analyze clustering performance compared to actual classes.

### 📌 Steps Included:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature analysis
3. Applying KMeans clustering
4. Using the Elbow method for optimal K
5. Dimensionality reduction using PCA
6. Visualizing the results
7. Evaluating cluster accuracy vs true classes

## 📌 Insights & Conclusion
- The clustering algorithm was able to group animals with high accuracy based on features.
- PCA helped us visualize the separation clearly.
- This project showcases how unsupervised learning can reveal patterns even without labeled data.

## 📎 How to Use
1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Run `Unsupervised_ML_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
3. Ensure `zoo.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
